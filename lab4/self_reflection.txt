All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A - no access.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Being able to figure out the circular indexing/topology on my own.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The lack of commenting and javadoc.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: More about circular indexing/topology.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Write an interface with the methods (as in proj1b) and then make it implement those methods.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A - no access.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Being able to figure out the recursive implementation of getRecursive() as well as using the debugger properly to visualise.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Again, javadoc/commenting. Although I did add that in proj1b.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing much.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Use an interface, as in proj1b. Perhaps write more test cases, because my removeLast had a bug that I fixed in proj1B.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: N/A - not from UCB :)
